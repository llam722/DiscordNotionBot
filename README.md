In order to ensure smooth setup, follow the steps below from the Notion documentation to allow database access for this integration:

<br/>

<ol>
<li>Go to the database page in your workspace.</li>
<li>Click the &nbsp; <b>•••</b> &nbsp; on the top right corner of the page.</li>
<li>At the bottom of the pop-up, click <b>Add connections.</b> </li>

Create a file named config.json and obtain your database ID to allow updating of the correct database. Easiest way is to click the <b>Share</b> icon then select <b>Copy Link</b> to extract the URL, where we will get the database ID from.
